-> DESCRIBE table_name - shows the structure of a specific table, including its columns and data types.

-> SELECT * FROM table_name - retrieves all rows and columns from a table.

-> INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, ...) - inserts a new row into a table.

-> UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ... WHERE condition - updates one or more rows in a table that meet a specific condition.

-> DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition - deletes one or more rows from a table that meet a specific condition.

-> CREATE TABLE table_name (column1 datatype1, column2 datatype2, ...) - creates a new table with the specified columns and data types.
